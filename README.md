# JMRTD-Unity
This project has a little modification compared with the original project JMRTD: a new method was added in the class **PassportService**: *doBACNow()*, because C# has a little problem with methods that have something to return. This new method is needed for the proper functioning of the NFC scan module (https://github.com/nailuj1992/unity_nfc).
